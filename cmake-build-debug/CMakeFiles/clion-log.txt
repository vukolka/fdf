CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibmlx.a.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "libmlx.a",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libmlx.a" with any
  of the following names:

    libmlx.aConfig.cmake
    libmlx.a-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libmlx.a" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libmlx.a_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "libmlx.a" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
